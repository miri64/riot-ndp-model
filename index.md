## Node classes
How the NIB is constructed is greatly dependent on what role the node takes in a network. Analysis of the corresponding RFCs resulted in the following made-up of node classes:

![Node classes](class_nodes.svg)

Depending on the node class certain features are compiled into the RIOT image of the node. This is marked with the corresponding color of the node class:

- Features of all IPv6 hosts are marked <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">black</span>
- features for IPv6 routers are marked <span style="color: #800000; font-weight: bold;">maroon</span>,
- features for all 6LoWPAN nodes (6LN) are marked <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold;">green</span>,
- features for 6LoWPAN routers (6LR) are marked <span style="color: #800080; font-weight: bold;">purple</span>, and
- features for 6LoWPAN border routers (6LBR) are marked <span style="color: #008080; font-weight: bold;">teal</span>.

Additional to their role in the network there are certain features that are beyond orthogonal to these roles:

- Components and behaviors required for the NDP address resolution state-machine (typically provided on non-6LoWPAN hosts and all routers) are marked <span style="color: #808000; font-weight: bold;">olive</span>,
- Nodes that start advertising themselves as routers on start-up are marked <span style="color: #ff6600; font-weight: bold;">orange</span>, and
- Nodes that do not advertising themselves as routers on start-up are marked <span style="color: #ffcc00; font-weight: bold;">gold</span>.

The reasoning for not including the NDP address resolution state-machine on non-routing 6LN is that on these kinds of nodes [non-link-local addresses are always considered off-link and the link-layer addresses of link-local addresses are derived from their IID][6lowpan-host-behavior]. So none of this information needs to be stored.

Furthermore, there are features the user can decide to de-/activate:

- Asynchronous error reporting is marked <span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">red</span>
- Queueing of packets for address resolution is marked <span style="color: #00ff00; font-weight: bold;">lime</span>
- Usage of a destination cache is marked <span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold;">navy</span>
- Handling of redirect messages (which requires a destination cache) is marked <span style="color: #2ad4ff; font-weight: bold;">azure</span>

Lastly, there are the components related to [6LoWPAN's two substitutable features][6lowpan-subst-feat]:

- Components related to multihop prefix and context distribution are marked <span style="color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold;">blue</span>, and
- Components related to multihop Duplicate Address Detetection are marked <span style="color: #ff00ff; font-weight: bold;">magenta</span>
